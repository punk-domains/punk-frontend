      <p>Klima Name Service (KNS) domains are regenerative domains that <strong>continuously offset your carbon footprint</strong> and act as social representations of your carbon neutrality or net zero pledges.</p>
      <p>KNS powers the <strong>Terraneutral platform</strong>, a social platform for Refi, suitable for both individuals and businesses.</p>
      <p>KNS also enables users to map <strong>human readable names</strong> to blockchain and non-blockchain resources, like Ethereum addresses, IPFS hashes, or website URLs. KNS domains can be bought and sold on secondary markets.</p>
      <p><strong>Refer anyone to get 10% from their purchase!</strong></p>
      <p>KNS tracks the average carbon tonnes retired per domain name and translates this into your carbon neutral journey as a domain owner.</p> 
      <p>It allows for a level of transparency into individuals or companies carbon neutral or climate positive status. It comes with a <strong>leader board of carbon tonnes </strong> that have been offsetted on-chain linked to .klima wallet addresses and a synopsis of the impact of the carbon tonne retired per domain.
      </p>
      <p>
      Ultimately, a .klima address allows you to connect your social identity and web3 presence in a simplified way. Through the Terraneutral platform, users will be able to amplify their neutral status and bridge this commitment into real life incentives through <strong>the .klima domain name: the green Identity Card.</strong>
      </p>
      <h3>Why would anyone need this?</h3>
      <p>
      In order for you and me to make climate action the ONLY option for us all, we must <strong>embed climate accountability and transparency into our daily lives.</strong></p>
      <p>KNS provides the first step through enabling holders to <strong>passively account for their pollution.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, if you want someone to send you tokens, sure you could send them your address and they could copy-paste it into their wallet. But wouldn't it be great if they could just enter a domain name, like timmy.klima, instead of the whole address? And they instantly know you live a carbon neutral life. <strong>This is what Klima Name Service provides: the green social identity.</strong></p> 
      <p>Another use case is to have <strong>your .klima domain name as your username in various web3 dApps, games and upcoming social networks.</strong>
      Imagine you wanted to check the footprint of Microsoft and they had a .klima domain. How great would it feel to type in: Microsoft.klima on your browser or the <strong>Terraneutral platform</strong> and you can see how much carbon they have offsetted and track their Net Zero status. This applies to every user. 
      </p>
      <h3>Why use .klima?</h3> 
      <p>
      We choose to use .klima because KLIMA embodies both our vision and the tools to achieve our mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong> The KLIMA token is a critical component to KNS, and we are klimates.</strong>

      <h3>Do you have a roadmap?</h3> 
      <p>
      The vision is to create accountability and transparency for climate change through social amplification and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
      Our road map includes the Terraneutral platform, Green identity card, green NFTs marketplace proxy, mobile app, Klima forest etc 
      </p>
      <h3>What is the price?</h3>
      <p> 
      KNS is not just a domain, it is the world’s first regenerative name service that offsets your footprint with real life utilities attached to it. <strong>KNS will be priced at 250USDC but starts from 100USDC at launch.</strong> So the earlier you are in, the cheaper it is. KNS is a permanent domain and not on subscription.
